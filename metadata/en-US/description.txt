Luno's mission is to change how employees share and find the information they need to do their jobs.

With Luno, you have access to all of the institutional knowledge of your company on the go. This can include things like product roadmaps, release notes, conference room info, company policies, etc. among others. All posts are attributed to people within the company and you can lookup the profiles of any co-workers to gain more context.

* Luno is currently only available to participating companies only. *
