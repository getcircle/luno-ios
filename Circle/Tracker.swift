/*
   This class acts as a wrapper for our mixpanel implementation.
   It is named generically such that there are no conflicts with the libraries.

   ASSUMPTION: It assumes the needed libraries (Mixpanel in this case) has been globally
   instantiated and will be present before any call to this class is made.

   CONVENTIIONS:
   - All event tracking methods are named as track{Event in present tense}.
     Its best to imagine a suffix Event when trying to name these.

   NOTE:
   The entire implementation here SHOULD be keept in sync with the spec.

    // Track Page View
    /*
        Page views is the event name we are using to keep things consistent with the web.
        A page view is defined as a distinct section of content that is loaded separately and
        for which a user has to take some action like a tap to see it.
        
        We also need to ensure we use the right signals from each platform. For e.g., iOS
        by its design is hierarchial and users have to go back to start on a new action. To account
        for this and to be as close to the web as possible, page views would be triggered typically
        from the viewDidLoad method of view controllers or at the entry points when a navigation
        is being explicitly triggered.
        
        For views that are always in the memory, for e.g., the views that are part of the tab
        bar controller, we can track the explicit action user takes to visit them.
        
        For our implementation, we are explicitly only tracking taps to the Search or Home 
        view and ignoring user's own profile visit. That is to not inflate profile detail
        views overall across web and mobile. In comparison, Home is the default view and
        is likely to get ignored anyways, but tracking it at the tab level allows us
        to track funnels correctly.

    /*
        Tracks the start of a search.
    
        Given the nature of real time search and auto-focus through specific gestures,
        there are multiple ways to indicate search was started.
        For e.g., a user can focus on search and immediately tap a recent search result,
        which can be tracked as a person started on search but the Recents feature helped
        take them to the result immediately. Same applies for Explore options as well.
        
        To simplify, we define search started when a user has typed at least two characters.
        A flag is maintained to track whether this event was recorded and it is reset when
        the character count reaches zero.
